# vagrant-freebsd-4.4-i386-minimal
A custom, minimal VirtualBox vagrant box of FreeBSD 4.4 i386, which is special custom for my another open source project [Z-Language](https://github.com/AlbertZheng/zlang-zvm). But you can also utilize it in your projects which need a FreeBSD 4.4 environment.

For more, please refer to [official hosting site of this box](https://app.vagrantup.com/AlbertZheng/boxes/vagrant-freebsd-4.4-i386-minimal).

>>> You can ignore below running errors because VirtualBox hasn't the GuestAdditions for FreeBSDï¼š

The configured shell (config.ssh.shell) is invalid and unable
to properly execute commands. The most common cause for this is
using a shell that is unavailable on the system. Please verify
you're using the full path to the shell and that the shell is
executable by the SSH user.
